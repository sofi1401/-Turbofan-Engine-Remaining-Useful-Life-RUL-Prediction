# -Turbofan-Engine-Remaining-Useful-Life-RUL-Prediction
This repository presents a complete end-to-end pipeline for **Predictive Maintenance** using NASA's CMAPSS Turbofan Engine dataset. The goal is to estimate the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of engines before failure, using progressively advanced techniques—from baseline machine learning to multimodal deep learning.
